The Trash Interceptor in Ballona Creek is a device designed to capture floating trash and debris before it enters the ocean. The device uses a conveyor system to collect and remove litter from the water, preventing it from harming marine life and ecosystems.

The Ocean Cleanup is an organization that develops and deploys advanced technologies to rid the world's oceans of plastic pollution. Their main focus is the development of a passive system to clean up plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is the largest accumulation of ocean plastic in the world. Their technology consists of a floating barrier that passively collects plastic while allowing marine life to swim underneath it.

This project is an active partnership between Los Angeles County and The Ocean Cleanup to prevent floating plastics from entering our oceans and a project that I spent nearly 3 years on.

I'm so proud of this experience and I hope that many more of these devices are installed around the world.
