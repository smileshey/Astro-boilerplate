The Oxford Basin is a flood control facility located in Marina del Rey, Los Angeles, California. It was built in the 1950s by the US Army Corps of Engineers to control flooding in the surrounding areas during heavy rains. The facility consists of a concrete-lined channel that collects stormwater runoff from nearby streets and directs it to a detention basin. The basin is designed to temporarily hold excess water during storms and slowly release it back into the surrounding environment. The basin is surrounded by a 6-acre wetland that provides habitat for various plants and wildlife species. The wetland also serves as a natural filter for the stormwater, helping to improve the water quality before it enters the ocean. 

The Oxford Basin facility is an important component of the Los Angeles County flood control system, and it also provides recreational opportunities for nearby residents and visitors.

Improvements were made to the facility over recent years to improve the function of the tide gates that control the circulation of water and prevent stagnation.
